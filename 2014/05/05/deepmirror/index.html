  <h1 class="post-title">Deep Mirror</h1>
  <span class="post-date">05 May 2014</span>
  <div style="float: right"><a href="https://github.com/jkominek/deepmirror/blob/d472b242cfda39e7a397ffd31b8079c45c3ab1b7/deep-bush.rkt"><img src="/assets/2014/05/deepmirror-deep-bush.png" /></a></div>

<p>I threw together a
<a href="http://contextfreeart.org/mediawiki/index.php/Context_Free_Art:About">CFDG</a>
inspired library for <a href="http://www.racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>, which
I named <a href="https://github.com/jkominek/deepmirror">Deep Mirror</a>.</p>

<p>CFDG popped up in maybe 2004? 2003? Somewhere back there. I played
with it some initially, then played with it again when the guys at
<a href="http://contextfreeart.org/">Context Free Art</a> made a version with
a nice GUI.</p>

<p>Short version is, you write a bunch of rules which behave as a generative
context free grammar. Various terminals in the grammar result in image
elements being created, and annotations on terminals (and nonterminals)
result in the state of the drawing system being altered. If you want to
make images out of recursive elements, this is a pretty good way to go.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://contextfreeart.org/gallery/search.php?by=kominek">made some
pictures</a>
with it, but the version of the language out then didn’t allow you to
write functions, or, as I recall, perform any arithmetic at all. People
did some neat things, and made some attractive art, but I got bored.</p>

<p class="message">the new thing</p>

<p>For whatever reason, it popped back up in my mind this week, and I
thought I’d try and stuff something like CFDGs into Racket, while
leaving you the full power of Racket. I wonder what else I might’ve
concocted if I’d had the entirety of the <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/math/index.html?q=math">math
library</a> available
to me back then.</p>

<p><div style="float: right"><img src="/assets/2014/05/deepmirror-curly-pentagon.png" /></div> Look at
that, it makes pictures. (code <a href="https://github.com/jkominek/deepmirror/blob/d472b242cfda39e7a397ffd31b8079c45c3ab1b7/curly-pentagon.rkt">here</a>)
And that picture right there is an example of why I made this, and why
I'm not quite done with it. See how the red tentacle thing is covered
up by the purple? The recursion is being done depth-first and the red
tentacle is completely drawn before the purple one starts.
</p>

<p>I arranged my library to behave a bit differently from the other
tools. Instead of applying arguments to the various rules/shapes, they
just inherit whatever the current drawing state is, sort of like
OpenGL.</p>

<p>You can only multiply new transformations
(<code>x</code>, <code>rotate</code>, <code>sheary</code>, etc) into
the current transformation matrix; no forcing the rotation or
translation to specific values. But the hue, saturation, brightness
and alpha can all be set to a specific value (with <code>hue=</code>,
<code>brightness=</code>, etc), or you can multiply the existing value
by a new one (with <code>saturation</code>, <code>alpha</code>, etc).</p>

<p>The state gets pushed and popped onto a stack, either with the
<code>scope</code> macro, or by calling a rule. <code>scope</code>
is convenient when a rule is going to branch, and you want to define
the changes for each branch in terms of your rule’s starting state,
rather than defining the second branch’s state in terms of the first’s.</p>

<p class="message">next?</p>

<p>Please note! I’d be happy to take <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">pull
requests</a> for
this stuff, or anything else that would be neat.</p>

<p>I want to get some continuation manipulation stuff going to rearrange
the order in which evaluation occurs. First (read: simplest) I want to
change the recursion to be breadth first, instead of depth first.
That’d take care of my tentacle problem above.</p>

<p>Second, I’d like to experiment with rearranging evaluation so that the
scale of the current transformation matrix is used to reorder all the
outstanding rules from largest to smallest. Or vice versa.  Keeping an
eye on the current scale would also let me cut off recursion
sooner. Once you’re down to drawing subpixel elements… well. You’d
have a lot of work to do to influence the final output.</p>

<p>Third, I’m hoping that while playing with these static alterations to
control flow, I might come up with some neat way for the user to
specify control flow, which fits with the style of CFDGs.</p>

<p>I’d also like to fiddle with the
<a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/parameterize.html">parameterization</a>
of the state. I’m a little worried that what I’m doing to keep the
state hidden in the background is doing tragic things to the performance.</p>

<p>Oh! Layers, so you can manipulate the z-index. Which would be
another way of getting my uncooperative tentacles arranged neatly.</p>
