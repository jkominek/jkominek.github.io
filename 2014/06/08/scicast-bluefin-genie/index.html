  <h1 class="post-title">SciCast, Bluefin-21, and GeNIe</h1>
  <span class="post-date">08 June 2014</span>
  <p>I’m going to assume you’re familiar with
<a href="https://scicast.org/#!/about">SciCast</a>; if you aren’t, that link is the
place to start. Or maybe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SciCast">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>There has been a open question on SciCast, <a href="https://scicast.org/#!/questions/464/safe">“Will Bluefin-21 locate
the black box from Malaysian Airlines flight
MH-370?”</a>, since mid-April.
(If you don’t know what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MH370">MH370</a>
is, I envy you.) It <a href="https://scicast.org/#!/questions/464/trades/safe">dropped fairly
quickly</a> to
predicting that there was a 10% chance of Bluefin-21 locating MH370.
Early on, that was reasonable enough. There was evidence pings from
the black box had been detected in the region, so the entire Indian
Ocean had been narrowed down to a relatively small area.</p>

<p>Unfortunately weeks passed and on May 29th <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-27615173">Bluefin-21’s mission was
completed</a>,
unsuccessfully. Bluefin-21 then stopped looking. At this point, I (and
others) expected the forecast to plummet. But folks kept
pushing it back up. In fact I count about 5 or 6 distinct individuals
who moved the probability up after completion of the mission. There
are perfectly good reasons related to the nature of the prediction
market for some of those adjustments.</p>

<p>I’m interested in the bad reasons.</p>

<p>One of the bad reasons that could apply to any question, but seems to
be a very likely candidate for this question, is being unaware of the
state of the world. Forecasting the future when you don’t know the
present just isn’t going to turn out very well. In the best case,
you’ve got really good priors, and you’re stuck working off of
those. Realistically, your priors aren’t that great. Evidence could
help them out, but you’re not updating.</p>

<p>In the specific case of the Bluefin-21, it was suggested (by someone
with whom I have no beef, and am not trying to single out!) that there
was still a chance MH370 would be discovered by going back and
reanalyzing the data.</p>

<p>This didn’t seem at all likely to me. I attempted to explain why,
though in retrospect I think my explanation was poor, and incomplete.</p>

<p>To formalize my reasoning, I hunted around for a software tool that
would let me crunch the numbers and make a diagram. I turned up
<a href="http://genie.sis.pitt.edu/">GeNIe</a>, which looked appropriate for the
task. GeNIe is a GUI on top of SMILE, which is a software library for
(<em>hand</em> <em>wave</em>) modeling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network">Bayesian
networks</a>.</p>

<p>I ended up producing this model and looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2014/06/bluefin-before-evidence.png" alt="Before Evidence" /></p>

<p>(If you want to fiddle with the model, you can <a href="/assets/2014/06/bluefin-model.xdsl">download it
here</a>.)</p>

<p>This model assumes Bluefin-21 is 90% effective on the first pass, and
reanalysis has a 20% chance to find MH370 if it was missed. It also
assumes that reanalysis will almost certainly happen, but that there
is only a 10% chance that MH370 is even in the search area. I feel
that’s generous given the search area, and nature of the acoustic
evidence. (I never thought the surface debris was likely to be
related.  There’s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_garbage_patch">lot of crap in the
ocean</a>. That
they found so little is just evidence of the size of the ocean.)</p>

<p>Based on all of that, the model says there’s a 9% chance Bluefin-21 would
find MH370. Which is about where the SciCast prediction was at. The
other forecasters might’ve been giving the pings more credit. Anyways,
we’re kind of in the ballpark. So let’s now tell the model that Bluefin-21
didn’t find MH370 on the first pass, and see what it says:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2014/06/bluefin-after-evidence.png" alt="After Evidence" /></p>

<p>Weee, the chance that Bluefin-21 will find anything has now dropped to
basically zero. And that’s because not finding the MH370 on the first
pass is evidence that it isn’t there, even if Bluefin-21 is
imperfect. In fact, the better Bluefin-21 is, the stronger the
evidence of absence. For any chance of detection to remain, Bluefin-21
would have to be good at collecting data, but the analysis would have
to be awful and error prone, unless you repeated it. I didn’t attempt
to model that in, because it would be so weird.</p>

<p>First, sonar is well understood, and Bluefin-21 was using COTS units
that basically produce a elevation model of the ocean floor. Second,
if “trying harder” upped the odds of detection, then the operators
would throw more CPU or man power at it until they’d raised the
likelihood of detection as high as it was reasonably going to go. The
cost of the search had hit at least $44 million before Bluefin-21 got
wet; some additional data analysis isn’t going to put a dent in that.
(Maybe you could find a signal processing researcher to apply some
cutting edge stuff, but if that didn’t happen at the start of the
search, I don’t think it’ll happen before the question expires.)</p>

<p>This question is pretty much over, but if you have suggestions for
making the model better, I’d be interested in hearing them. This is
the first thing I’ve done with this sort of modeling tool. So I’m
sure some things could be done better.</p>

<p class="message">
next?
</p>

<p>I plan to make further use of GeNIe for my SciCasting. For starters,
the models make it easier to break apart the separate components of my
belief. I can also tweak nodes and have the machine handle propagating
the change, which will be much more accurate than fuzzily doing it in
my head.</p>

<p>Using some of the fancier(?) features should also allow me to
focus my forecasting efforts and points on the questions where I can
get the best returns. (Basically by answering the obvious question
of “Am I sure enough to make it worth it?”)</p>

<p>Finally, I’d like to put my models up like this, along with some
explanation. That way I can demonstrate that I’m predicting the future
on the basis of cunning and wit, not piles of luck. ☺</p>
