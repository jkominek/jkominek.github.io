  <h1 class="post-title">How to ReCode</h1>
  <span class="post-date">28 April 2014</span>
  <p><div style="float: right"><img src="/assets/2014/04/recode-photocopy.png" width="200" /></div> The <a href="http://recodeproject.com">ReCode Project</a> popped up in 2012,
with the neat goal of taking old computer art, and writing new
programs (in <a href="http://processing.org/">processing</a>) that
regenerate the art, or close approximations.  This is made tricky
enough by the lack of source code, and little to no description of the
algorithm(s) used.</p>

<p>To make it slightly more challenging, the original material looks
like it was run through a cheap photocopier a couple of times. Weee.</p>

<p>I came across a link to the project... hm, who knows. Probably some
awful site with lots of comments. I hadn't done any work with
processing at that point. Obviously the thing to do was
participate.</p>

<p>I think the art on there can be placed along a sort of "pain in the ass"
gradient, from most to least:
<ul>
<li> The art uses some preexisting bitmapped artwork. Like <a href="http://recodeproject.com/artwork/v1n3gente">a picture of some
guy</a>. Without the picture, it'll be hard to duplicate. One of them
<a href="http://recodeproject.com/artwork/v1n2universal-declaration-of-human-rights">clearly
uses a different photo</a>. I'm far too particular to do that.
</li>

<li>
One step up, the art uses some nonobvious data. <a href="http://recodeproject.com/artwork/v1n2detail-from-tapestry">Or maybe it was just random</a>. There
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext_indistinguishability#Indistinguishable_from_random_noise">isn't much difference</a>. So
you could generate a bunch of random things which are all in the same style,
but never exactly the same thing. If I wanted to do that, <a href="http://www.contextfreeart.org/gallery/search.php?by=kominek">I'd be playing</a> with <a href="http://www.contextfreeart.org/">context free</a>.
</li>

<li>
Further along that path, the art uses obvious data. Such as <a href="http://recodeproject.com/static/img/cards/v2n1/03.png">US population density</a>.
That's actually kind of tempting.
</li>

<li>
Finally, we reach the nice "easy" pieces, which are almost purely
geometric.  Like Sture Johannesson's "<a href="http://recodeproject.com/artwork/v1n2topographic-form">Topographic Form</a>", which
ended up being the piece I chose to work on.
</li>
</ul>

That's just an excerpt, the original doesn't have the nice square
aspect ratio. If you decide to snarf the PDF so you can see the
original, head's up: it is 20.2MiB.</p>

<p>I looked at it for awhile, screwed around some, probably did a little
bit of whatever I was supposed to be doing. Stuff 'n things.</p>

<p class="message">
the process
</p>
<p>When I look at that I see a circle, with 270° arcs on either side
of it. Hm, nope, I see three arcs. 270°, 360°, 270°. That's easier
to deal with.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/2014/04/recode-topographic-arcs.svg" /></center>

<p>Then a half-circle has been extruded along the lengths of
the arcs, producing a 3D volume. We could stop there, and feed that
into a ray tracer, and have a nice "realistic" looking image.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/2014/04/recode-topographic-povray.png" /></center>

<p>Yeah, about like that! Who doesn't like some nice perfectly smooth
jade floating above an infinite checkboard? If you'd like to enjoy
some 90's <a href="http://povray.org/">POV-Ray</a> flashbacks, you can <a href="/assets/2014/04/recode-topographic-povray.pov">play with the
source</a> for that image, too.</p>

<p>
<div style="float: right">
<img src="/assets/2014/04/recode-topographic-nohidden.png" />
</div>
We've got some nice geometry now, but the general appearance isn't
even close. Ray tracing clearly wasn't used. In fact, if you look at
the inside of circle, near the bottom, I think it is clear that no
hidden surface removal was performed. My assumption, and what
I went with in my version, is that it is just made up
of some lines being drawn in 3D space. The renderer doesn't have
any idea that it is depicting solid surfaces.
</p>

<p>At this point, you might want to <a href="http://recodeproject.com/translation/jay-kominek-topographic-form-direct-topographic-form-sture-johannesson">reference
my code</a>. I started with the <code>RaisedArc</code> class, which
represents the arc segments, and computes their height. Just some
trig going on there. Take a point, figure out how high that arc is
at that point.</p>

<p>The <code>draw</code> function can then just drag a "pen" across
the X-Y plane, stopping along the way and asking each arc how high it
is.  Take the max, and you reconstruct the surface of the object we
rendered:</p>

<center><img src="/assets/2014/04/recode-topographic-toonice.png" /></center>

<p>
When I hit that, I felt that my decisions up to this point were
justified. This felt like the same image, and maybe it is even what
the original artist would've wanted to make if they'd had anything
close to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Graphics_Adapter">EGA</a>
resolution available. But they didn't. So this image is too "nice",
and certainly too smooth. Of particular concern, the truncated ends
of the left and right arcs don't even look right anymore. In the original,
they actually hint at a bit of perspective, even though I believe the
image was rendered orthographically.
</p>

<p>"Fixing" the smoothness is taken care of in two steps. First,
we up the step size (<code>fx_step</code>) until the lines are
made of distinct segments. Then <code>noSmooth()</code> turns off
processing's attempts to help us out and make the lines look nicer.
Conveniently, increasing the step sizes makes the truncation of the
arcs much rougher, and gives us the pseudo-perspective appearance.
That's handy because 1) now I don't have to do anything else and 2)
it acts (in my mind) as further evidence that the original was drawn
orthographically instead of in perspective.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/2014/04/recode-topographic-final.png" /></center>

<p>I counted the number of horizontal lines in the original, and sort
of eyeballed the other proportions. The <code>fy-0.5</code> in the
call to <code>computeHeight</code> is to scoot the geometry around
until the lines appear to be falling across it as they do in the original.</p>

<p>The stroke width, and tilt of the X-Y plane were both determined by
just fiddling around with things. ...I just noticed that the angle I concocted,
of 28.12° is 0.4907 radians. I'm guessing that means the original used
a round 0.5 radians. Maybe I'll change that some time. Ehh.</p>

<p class="message">
next?
</p>

<p>The same "rendering engine" used for this piece could actually be applied
to the map of the United States referenced above. Clip off stuff outside the
borders, and replaced <code>RaisedArc</code> with something that reads a data
file, and bam. That could be fun.</p>

<p>I'm also tempted to do Roger Coqart's <a href="http://recodeproject.com/artwork/v3n2from-the-square-series">From
the Square Series</a>. It isn't clear to me that there is a pattern in
how the lines are placed, but I think we could get fairly close with some
rules about the distribution of line segments. Perhaps adding them at random
until they get close to satisfying some rules.</p>
