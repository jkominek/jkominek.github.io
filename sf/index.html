      This is stuff for the stockfighter peeps.

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

Code:
<ul>
  <li><a href="/assets/code/api.py">api.py</a></li>
  <li><a href="/assets/code/amends.py">amends.py</a></li>
  <li><a href="/assets/code/analyzefills.py">analyzefills.py</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Reading the level description, I figured that the level would involve
normalish trading, then a sudden shift of some sort, followed by more
normal trading. The inside trader would be the guy who profited the most
by the sudden shift. To figure that out, I needed to know at least roughly
how much everybody profited.</p>

<p>When I initially read the API docs, the lack of real authentication on the
executions websocket stuck out like the sore thumb. So I went back looking
for a way to find account numbers. I found the error message on order
cancellation, and worked with that. Most of <code>amends.py</code> is
concerned with figuring out what order IDs exist, trying to cancel
every single one of them to check for new account numbers, and then starting
websockets to watch for that account's executions.</p>

<p>The remaining bit of intelligence produces occasional summaries, and
dumps all of the execution information to a file.</p>

<p><code>analyzefills.py</code> takes those dumps, and does more involved
analysis, offline, including making some files for gnuplot. What I found
was:

<ul>
  <li>No sudden shift seemed to occur.</li>
  <li>There were about 3 traders selling lots of stock. They didn't look to be making any money, so I wrote them off.</li>
  <li>A whole bunch of traders that make a market orders occasionally. It seemed unlikely the inside trader could be getting rich off of super low volume market orders. Wrote them off.</li>
  <li>What was left was a bunch of traders that were all trading about the same amount, and maybe making money. So I watched them.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>And, honestly, before I got too far with that, I noticed there was always
one of them that placed about half as many orders as the rest. Since you've
implemented these traders as programs, different behavior suggests a different
program. One unique program out of a big pile sounded like the inside
trader, so I accused it. That worked.</p>

<p>Ran the thing again, found the same trader trading half as fast as the rest,
and accused it again with the link to this page. And I was right again.</p>

<p>So, bam. All done.</p>

<p>Stockfighter reminded me of trading
on <a href="http://scicast.org/">SciCast</a>, which I really enjoyed
(and wrote <a href="http://hypercomplex.net/">some blog posts about
it</a>).  I think at the end I was in second place on it, and I was
using an
<a href="http://github.com/jkominek/forecasting">automated trading program</a>
that I wrote for it. Stockfighter brought back some good memories. :)
Thanks for that.
